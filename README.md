# Person CRUD Application Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4. This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server including CRUD operations, pagination, and more.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use `npm` for managing the dependancies. Run `npm i` to install all the dependancies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The Backend server source code has been attached [here](https://github.com/kannangr21/CRUD-NodeJS-MySQL).

## Functionality overview

The example application is a simple CRUD application where we can add, retrieve, update, and delete a record. It uses a custom API for all requests, including pagination, sorting, and more.
